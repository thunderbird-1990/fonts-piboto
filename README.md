# Piboto

This is an archive of the Piboto font, which is a fork of Roboto before the 2014 redesign.

The font files are of version 1.2 and taken from the Raspberry Pi [archive](https://archive.raspberrypi.org/debian/pool/main/f/fonts-piboto/).

## Licenses

Most font files are released under the Apache License (same as Roboto), but some are licensed under the SIL Open Font License.
